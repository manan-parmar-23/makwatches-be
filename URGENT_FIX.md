# ðŸš¨ URGENT FIX REQUIRED ðŸš¨

## The Problem
Your Docker username is configured as `adityagarg646` but your actual Docker Hub username is `aditya110`.

Your repository exists at: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/aditya110/makwatches-be

---

## âš¡ QUICK FIX - Do These 3 Steps NOW

### Step 1: Update GitHub Secret (CRITICAL)
1. Open: https://github.com/manan-parmar-23/makwatches-be/settings/secrets/actions
2. Find `DOCKER_USERNAME`
3. Click "Update"
4. Change value to: **`aditya110`**
5. Click "Update secret"

### Step 2: Fix Server Configuration
Open your terminal and run these commands:

```bash
# SSH to your server
ssh root@139.59.71.95

# Go to deployment directory
cd /opt/makwatches-be

# Backup current .env
cp .env .env.backup

# Edit .env file
nano .env
```

In the nano editor:
1. Find the line: `DOCKER_USERNAME=adityagarg646`
2. Change it to: `DOCKER_USERNAME=aditya110`
3. Press `Ctrl+X`, then `Y`, then `Enter` to save

### Step 3: Deploy with Correct Image

Still on the server, run:

```bash
# Stop containers
docker compose down

# Remove wrong image (if exists)
docker rmi adityagarg646/makwatches-be:latest 2>/dev/null

# Pull correct image
docker pull aditya110/makwatches-be:latest

# Start services
docker compose up -d

# Check if it's running
docker ps

# Test the API
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

## âœ… Verification

After completing the steps:

1. **Check container is running:**
   ```bash
   docker ps | grep makwatches-be
   ```
   
2. **Check logs:**
   ```bash
   docker compose logs -f api
   ```

3. **Test API:**
   ```bash
   curl http://139.59.71.95:8080/health
   ```

## ðŸ”„ Future Deployments

After fixing GitHub Secrets (Step 1), all future deployments will automatically:
1. Build image as `aditya110/makwatches-be`
2. Push to your Docker Hub
3. Deploy to server with correct username

Test by pushing a commit:
```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "Test deployment with correct username"
git push origin main
```

Then watch: https://github.com/manan-parmar-23/makwatches-be/actions
